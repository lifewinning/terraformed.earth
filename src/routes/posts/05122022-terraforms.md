## A good read
Maddie Stone on [efforts to obtain critical minerals in less environmentally shitty ways](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/mining-is-a-polluting-business-can-new-tech-make-it-cleaner): this is a really useful piece in terms of indexing the state of emerging technologies. A colleague at UD sometimes complains about opposition to mining not being <Aside label="solutions-oriented"><span>This is, I think, a positon rooted in different interpretations of the *problem*, not a refusal of solutions, but I always feel like a bit of a troll when I say that.</span></Aside>, so it's nice to have a counterpoint for that position.
