I'm not entirely sure what I want this to be, but I didn't want it to be a newsletter or a blog on an existing platform mainly because I wanted to be able to include <Aside label='custom details'><p>Like little dropdown side notes instead of footnotes!</p></Aside> and I missed the process of making a janky little custom website of one's own--something imperfect and annoying (the styling on these markdown posts is honestly one of the worst things I've ever done) but <Aside label="mostly"><p>I did use [a rando Github demo project](https://github.com/mvasigh/sveltekit-mdsvex-blog) as scaffolding, but in my defense I am not of the generation that needed 10,000 javascript libraries to make a website and I am still getting used to your ways.</p></Aside> mine.

I think I just wanted somewhere to put all the weird small things that weren't quite polished Content but I also didn't want to lose to the slipstream of social media timelines. That's all. 

<script>
  import Aside from '$lib/components/Aside.svelte'
